# Ear Trainer

Ear Trainer is an iOS app that will definitely give you absolute pitch and nothing less

## Installation

The app is written in swift 5 and uses CocoaPods, so you need to install them before building the app

```bash
git clone git@github.com:arturs105/ear-trainer.git
cd ear-trainer
pod install
open "Ear Training.xcworkspace"
```

You may encounter an error when building with Xcode about Beethoven CocoaPod being in an unsupported swift version. To fix that you need to change swift version for that pod to version 4.
